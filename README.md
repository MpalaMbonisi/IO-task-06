Please create a program that gets from the user [ three first digits of some bank account ], then loads the contents of the file text from the page( 
https://ewib.nbp.pl/plewibnra?dokNazwa=plewibnra.txt )
and get two interesting pieces of information from the loaded file :

- an abbreviated number
- the name of the bank

Thanks to these two pieces of information,  the program returns to the user, the bank name.
